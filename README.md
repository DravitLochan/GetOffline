# GetOffline
GetOffline is an Android application, which has been made purely for educational purposes. Open the app, click on the button to take a webpage offline and enter the URL of the page you want to take offline. Since this is for educational purposes only, the graphics of the page taken offline may be different and maybe in only readable format. This app focuses on the problem which geeks suffer that in absence of internet access, they are'nt able to use the free time they have.(Just kidding about the geek stuff. I too suffer through such problems. And mate trust me, If you visit the web for learning purposes, This is what you need) Make sure that you are connected to the internet while you enter the URL of the page you want to take offline. This app is a result of some stuff that I learnt in past 2 days. Jsoup has been used to take the source code of the given URL only.  Later I am planing to take the list of anchor tags present in the page and take them offline too.   


status:-

1.bug due to sharedpreferences class. comment it out and app is running properly. So need to implement it properly. 

2. add method to scrap the given url. store the code apropriately, such that the file runs and shows the scraped document in webview.

3. list the urls in recycler view and add its functionality.
 


Cheers! Happy Coding!
