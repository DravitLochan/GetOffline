# GetOffline
GetOffline is an Android application, which has been made purely for
educational purposes. Open the app, click on the button to take a webpage 
offline and enter the URL of the page you want to take offline. Since this
is for educational purposes only, the graphics of the page taken offline may
be different and maybe in only readable format. This app focuses on the problem
which geeks suffer that in absence of internet access, they are'nt able to use
the free time they have.(Just kidding about the geek stuff. I too suffer through 
such problems. And mate trust me, If you visit the web for learning purposes,
This is what you need) Make sure that you are connected to the internet while you 
enter the URL of the page you want to take offline. This app is a result of some stuff
that I learnt in past 2 days. Jsoup has been used to take the source code of the given
URL only.  Later I am planing to take the list of anchor tags present in the page and
take them offline too.   


status:-


1. recyclerview needs to be added.		--top most priority

2. report a page not being scraped. 		--2nd update

3. check url exists or not.			--done

4. share a saved page.				--2nd update

5. do the scraping part in async's		--on to it 
doInBackground.


Cheers! Happy Coding!
