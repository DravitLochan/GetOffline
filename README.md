# GetOffline
GetOffline is an Android application, developed purely for
educational purposes. Open the app, click on the button to take a webpage 
offline and enter the URL of the page you want to take offline. Since this
is for educational purposes only, the graphics of the page taken offline may
be different and maybe in only readable format. This app focuses on the problem
which geeks suffer that in absence of internet access, they are'nt able to use
the free time they have. (If you visit the web for learning purposes,
This is what you need) Make sure that you are connected to the internet while you 
enter the URL of the page you want to take offline. 


Cheers! Happy Coding!
